# Linux-updater
A simple shell script for updating and cleaning fedora, arch and ubuntu based systems that i use in my day to day.

# How it works
The code verify which package manager binaries are present 
on the system and selects commands according to founded binaries, 
thus using the correct commands for each distro.

# How to use
In terminal, go to the directory where the file is and run the command 
"sudo bash <a href="https://github.com/RaphaelAzambuja/Linux-updater/blob/main/updater.sh">updater.sh</a>".
